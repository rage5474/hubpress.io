== Motivation ==
Last time I thought that I would be nice to evaluate automated the output of an application started by Eclipse. E.g. to get an error dialog message when an exception is thrown or at least see an log entry in the Error Log View. Then I thought I would be nice to enable the Eclipse User to write directly a script in Eclipse that evaluates the console output directy. We implemented a similar approach in our Eclipse RCP based application at Elektrobit. After a few minutes searching the internet I found the Eclipse project EASE, that is enabling scripting for Eclipse. But I found not that much tutorials for that and that's why I want to blog about it. 

== Installation ==

I tested the installation with a clean Neon (Version 2) Eclipse. The download links for EASE can be found hier http://www.eclipse.org/ease/download/ .

Installation is as usual:

- Start Eclipse
- *Help* -> *Install New Software...*
- Enter following address in the *Work with* field: 
* http://download.eclipse.org/ease/update/release (Currently release 0.3.0) or
* http://download.eclipse.org/ease/update/nightly (Currently release 0.4.0 - don't know when it will be released)
- Check all features and click *Next* and
- again *Next* and
- accept licenses and click *Finish* and
- accept warning dialog and
- restart Eclipse after installation has finished.

== Basic usage ==
There is a special perspective for scripting, to activate it simple click *CTRL-3* for *Quick Access* and type scripting
and select select *Scripting* from the *Perspective* section. 

After the perspective switch your Eclipse should look like this:

You can see three important views in this perspective, the Script Explorer, Script Shell, and the Module Explorer. 

=== Script Shell ===

The easiest way to play around with EASE is to use the Script Shell. This is an interpreter for different scripting languages. Default script engine is Rhino (JavaScript). Following picture explains main features of the script shell.

 (1) Enter your script commands here (Script Input Field, e.g. print("Hello World.")).
 (2) Entered commands and results can be found here (Script Console).
 (3) Start here script recording, toggle button again to save your commands to a script file.
 (4) Load modules by mouse.
 (5) Clear Script Console (is not resetting script engine)
 (6) Hide Variable area.
 (7) Switch script engine(e.g from JavaScript to Python)
 (8) Reset script engine.
 (9) Open an additional script engine. 
(10) Open help.

Script shell is nice to play, but in the most cases people want to write script to re-use them.
