= Eclipse RCP 3.x with Compatibility Layer =

Today I want to show a step-by-step tutorial how to build a simple Eclipse RCP 3.x application based on Eclipse Mars.

== Motivation ==
* There exists many Eclipse RCP 3.x applications, which cannot be moved to the latest Eclipse RCP version. 
* There are a few descriptions what must be done to use the Compatibility Layer, but no step-by-step tutorial

== Background ==
