= Eclipse RCP 3.x with Compatibility Layer =

Today I want to show a step-by-step tutorial how to build a simple Eclipse RCP 3.x application based on Eclipse Mars.

== Motivation ==
* There exists many Eclipse RCP 3.x applications, which cannot be moved to the latest Eclipse RCP version. 
* There are a few descriptions in the internet what must be done to use the Compatibility Layer, but no step-by-step tutorial

== Background ==
* If you not know what the compatibility layer is than read this https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2013/february/article3.php
* If you want more background information about migrating strategies of Eclipse RCP 3.x than read this http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2016/01/08/migrating-from-eclipse-3-x-to-eclipse-4-e4/ 

== Prerequisite ==
* Download Eclipse RCP and RAP for Mars from here http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-rcp-and-rap-developers/mars2

== Tutorial ==
To create a simple feature-based Eclipse RCP 3.x application we need for plug-ins:

* One plug-in with UI logic (here only an example table): _io.rage5474.rcp.example.ui.plugin_
* One feature plug-in with represents the feature for the UI plug-in(s): _io.rage5474.rcp.example.ui.feature_
* One target platform plug-in, which contains only the taegt platform file: _io.rage5474.rcp.example.tp_
* One product plug-in, which contains the product configuration: _io.rage5474.rcp.example.product_

So let us start. 

=== Create sample plug-in ===
First we create the plug-in _io.rage5474.rcp.example.ui.plugin_ with our simple application logic. Therefore we use the integrated plug-in generator. Go to *File -> New -> Other* and select *Plug-in Project* from the folder *Plug-in Development*.

After clicking *Next* you have to add your plug-in name, here _io.rage5474.rcp.example.ui.plugin_.

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-2.png[width=500,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-2.png"]

After clicking *Next* we have to select the option *Would you like to create a rich client application?* to *Yes*. 

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-3.png[width=500,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-3.png"]

Again a click on *Next* leads us to the plug-in generator. Select here *RCP 3.x application with a view* 

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-4.png[width=500,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-4.png"]

and *Finish* the dialog. In the end you should have a new plug-in in your workspace, that looks similar to this one:

Cool, first step was successful. Let us go on.

=== Create sample feature ===

As I think it is better to work with feature (groups of plug-ins) instead of working only with plug-ins, we have to create a feature plug-in, that contains in the end only one plug-in. We name the feature plug-in _io.rage5474.rcp.example.ui.feature_.

So start again with *File -> New -> Other* and select *Feature Project* from the folder *Plug-in Development*. Enter the feature name _io.rage5474.rcp.example.ui.feature_ and click *Finish*.

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-6.png[width=500,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-6.png"]

Now you should have a second plug-in in your workspace. Open the file _feature.xml_ (simply be double-click), which is located in _io.rage5474.rcp.example.ui.feature_. Go to the tab _Included Plug-ins_ on the bottom of the editor and click *Add*. A new window should come up. Select the plug-in with the name _io.rage5474.rcp.example.ui.plugin_ and click *OK*. 

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-7.png[width=1024,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-7.png"]

Save the _feature.xml_ file (_CTRL-S_). 

So step 2 was also successful! 

=== Create target platform plug-in ===

Now we must create our target-platform (contains all Eclipse RCP plug-ins we need to get our application running!). I decided to use here Eclipse Mars as target platform. So we put the target platform file in a separate plug-in. We start again with *File -> New -> Other* and select *Project* from the folder *General*. Enter the corresponding plug-in name, here _io.rage5474.rcp.example.tp_ and click *Finish*.

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-8.png[width=500,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-8.png"]

Now we add a Target Definition file to this project. Go to *File -> New -> Other* and select *Target Definition* from the folder *Plug-in Development* and click *Next*.

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-9.png[width=500,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-9.png"]

Now select the our target platform plug-in _io.rage5474.rcp.example.tp_, add _mars.target_ as *File name* and select the option *Nothing* from the section *Initialize the target definition with:* and click *Finish*.

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-10.png[width=500,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-10.png"]

Now we have our third plug-in. At the moment our Target Definition file is empty. So open it with a double-click on the file _mars.target_ and click the *Add* button to add a Software Site to this Target Definition. 

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-11.png[width=1024,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-11.png"]

Select *Software Site* and click *Next*.

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-12.png[width=500,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-12.png"]

Enter following URL in the field *Work with* and hit enter: _http://download.eclipse.org/releases/mars_ .
Search and select following three features:

* Eclipse RCP
* Equinox p2, minimal support for RCP applications
* Eclipse Platform Launcher Executables

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-13.png[width=500,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-13.png"]

Use the search field to find the right feature fast. Tip: Disable *Group by Category*.

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-14.png[width=500,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-14.png"]

Click on *Finish* and click *Set as Target Platform*. After a while the target platform should be available. 

=== Create sample product ===

So we almost finished. We only need the possibility to start our application, therefore we need a product file. 
We separate this again in a new plug-in. We start again with *File -> New -> Other* and select *Project* from the folder *General* and enter the plug-ins name _io.rage5474.rcp.example.product_ and click *Finish*. 

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-15.png[width=500,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-15.png"]

Now we have to add a *Product Configuration* file to that plug-in. We create this with *File -> New -> Other* and select *Product Configuration* from the folder *Plug-in Development* and click *Next*.

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-16.png[width=500,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-16.png"]

Select the right plug-in (_io.rage5474.rcp.example.product_) and enter a product configuration file name, here _example.product_ and click Finish.

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-17.png[width=500,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-17.png"]

Now we have to configure our product. Open the product file (_example.product_) by double clicking. Click on new and select the plug-in _io.rage5474.rcp.example.ui.plugin_ in the field *Defining Plug-in* and enter a *Product ID*, e.g. _rcp_product_. Before clicking *Finish* switch the toogle button from *plug-ins* to *features*.

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-18.png[width=1024,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-18.png"]

Now switch to the tab *Contents* and add following feature by clicking on the *Add* button:

* org.eclipse.rcp
* org.eclipse.emf.common
* org.eclipse.emf.ecore
* io.rage5474.rcp.example.ui.feature

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-19.png[width=1024,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-19.png"]

Now we have to modify the run configuration. Switch to the tab *Configuration* and select *Add Recommended*.

image::complayer/comp-layer-tut-20.png[width=1024,link="/images/complayer/comp-layer-tut-20.png"]

Save your product definition file (_CTRL-S_) and switch back to the tab *Overview* and click the link _Synchronize_ from the section *Test*. 

=== Launch example application ===

Now we can give it a try. Click the link _Launch an Eclipse Application_ again from the section *Testing*.
The result should look similar to this:
